Change projects section to appear more like windows live-tiles 
Some tiles update periodically (weather app etc.), others are static (calculator etc.) 
Mousing over a tile expands it to show a description underneath it (e.g. mousing over the weather app displays 'weather app' underneath it) 
Arcade app will probably work like a folder; mousing over it will expand it to show the individual games' tiles
